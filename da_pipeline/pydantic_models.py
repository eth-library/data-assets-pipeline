OAIS-Compliant Data Models for Digital Preservation

This module defines a hierarchy of Pydantic models that implement the OAIS
(Open Archival Information System) reference model for digital preservation.
The models enforce data validation and maintain relationships between different
components of a Submission Information Package (SIP).

Model Hierarchy:
    SIPModel
    ├── IEModel (Intellectual Entity)
    │   ├── DublinCore (Metadata)
    │   └── RepresentationModel
    │       └── FileModel
    │           └── FixityModel

Key Features:
    - Full OAIS compliance
    - Dublin Core metadata support
    - Strict data validation
    - Immutable fixity records
    - UUID-based identification
    - Hierarchical representation
    - Timestamp normalization

Usage:
    ```python
    from da_pipeline.pydantic_models import SIPModel, IEModel

    # Create a new SIP
    sip = SIPModel(
        sip_id="unique_id",
        submitting_agent="agent_name",
        intellectual_entities=[...]
    )

    # Validation is automatic
    sip.creation_date = "invalid_date"  # Raises ValidationError
    ```

Note:
    All models use Pydantic's validation system to ensure data integrity
    and OAIS compliance. Fields are documented with clear descriptions
    and validation rules.
